Hi Abe,
 
I managed to get a GUSTO-equivalent spectrometer up and running here today.
I can reproduce your small data files here, it is a bug in the C-software. I have patched it on the machine here and it gives 800k datafiles now (with full resolution on the HIFAS).
I have compiled a patched binary app that you can test, it is attached as zip to this email.
 
I also fixed the "ACS_SETUP" return bytes so that tftp_upload flag in byte 3 is also sent back.
To solve the catchup problem I've added a buffer clear on ACS_ABORT command. Let me know if this works for you.
 
 
To test it I propose the following:
Mount a NFS share using the phrase outlined in /flash/rc.local
Run the gusto binary from the NFS with the same flags as /flash/rc.local, i.e.
gusto --unit 2 --fs 4500 --lags 512 --K2V1 6285.8 --M2V1 2080 &
 
Run your scripts to set up the measurement with filename, path/tftp destination, power on correlator and trigger the integration.
Check the data files.
 
 
If you are happy with the changes:
Move original binary - mv /flash/gusto /flash/gusto_factory (there should be ample room in the flash to keep the original, and we can revert if something goes wrong)
Copy new binary to /flash - cp /mnt/gusto /flash
 
Reboot spectrometer to see that it runs from the new binary in flash.
 
 
 
Best regards,
Kalle



Abe's Edits: small deltas.  
1) The gusto_factory is currently in /usr/bin on our spectrometers.  Move to flash to store.
2) rc.local will look in /usr/bin to start gusto, put full path to /flash/gusto to run the new one.

Should get this with the old one:

Should get this with the new one:
